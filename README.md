# Exploratory-Analysis-LinkedIn-Connections-&-Invitations

Exploratory analysis of connections and invitations LinkedIn data from 10 different user with similar interest in data related careers.

## Summary & Insights

### Inspiration
I have seen a drastic change in my social network activity, switching my focus from personal to a career focused social network in LinkedIn. My eagerness to switch my career and become a data scientist has led me to dedicate more time to build my network, increased my amount of invitations and overall spend more time using LinkedIn. I imagine it is the same for some of my peers in the Santa Clara Univerisity Masters in Business Analytics program who are looking to start their careers in data related fields. I really appreciate their willingness to share their personal LinkedIn data with me to allow me to have a better data story. 

### Where Our Connections Work?

I was a little surprised to see that even though I have fewer connections than other peers, the amount of connections that work at my current workplace is by far the majority of people. Working in a big campus with 1,000 plus employees has allowed me to build a network of people from my current company. To no surprise, Santa Clara University and the big tech companies of the Bay Area made this top 12 list along with some companies where my peers work.

### What Our Connections Do?

Clearly the top 10 positions are dominated by tech and data related jobs. This tells me we're connecting with the right people, just need to make sure we connect with more recruiters :)

### What Are Connections Hours of "Operation"?

This heatmap clearly shows how most people start the working weeks more actively in LinkedIn and tend to slow down during weekends, there is also no surprise that the early morning hours are not usually a time when people connect. Tuesday is definitely the day to connect with a peak hour at 11 pm.

### Sent vs. Received

I recently read an article about the 3,000 limit of connection invites a LinkedIn user has, I have definitely stepped up my game this year and sent tons of connections requests, especially after connecting with people at school and data science conferences. It is also easy to see how Dan has a completely different story and instead has been receiving connection requests, I guess being a talented data scientist is the Bay Area is a magnet for LinkedIn request
